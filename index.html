          <h1>What does k-pop stand for?</h1>
            <p>K-pop stand for Korean pop like for example C-pop for Chinese pop, J-pop for Japanese pop or even T-pop for Tailand pop</p>

           <h1><em>History</em></h1>
            <h3><strong>Origin of korean pop</strong></h3>
            <p>The history of Korean popular music can be traced back to 1885 when an American
               missionary, Henry Appenzeller, began teaching American and British folk songs at
               a school.These songs were called <em>changga</em> in Korean, and they were typically based
               on a popular Western melody sung with Korean lyrics.</p>

               <p>During the Japanese rule <em>(1910â€“1945)</em> the popularity of changga songs rose
                  as Koreans expressed their feelings against Japanese oppression through music.
                  The Japanese confiscated the existing changga collections and published lyrics
                  books of their own.The first known Korean pop album was <strong>"Yi Pungjin Sewol"</strong>,
                  by Park Chae-seon and Lee Ryu-saek in 1925, which contained popular songs
                  translated from Japanese.</p>

            <h3><strong>Agengies</strong></h3>
            <p>K-pop has spawned an entire industry encompassing music production houses, event
              management companies, music distributors, and other merchandise and service providers.
              They are responsible for recruiting, financing, training, and marketing new artists as
              well as managing their musical activities and public relations. Currently, the agency
              with the greatest market share is S.M. Entertainment.In 2011, together with Star
              J Entertainment, AM Entertainment, and Key East, the Big Three companies founded the
              joint management company <em>United Asia Management</em>.S</p>

              <h3><strong>Culture</strong></h3>
                <p>K-pop artists are frequently referred to as idols or idol groups.
                  Groups usually have a leader, who is often the eldest or most experienced
                  member and speaks for the group. The youngest group member is called the
                  maknae.K-pop groups often are very delineated, with each member having a
                  specific role or roles within the group. Roles are divided mainly into singing,
                  dancing, and rapping, with <em>"main"</em>, <em>"lead"</em>, or <em>"sub"</em> added before the main role
                  to differentiate between the skill level or position of the members in the group.
                  Groups also have <em>"visuals"</em>, who are the most traditionally beautiful or handsome
                  member of the group. The <em>"face"</em> of the group refers to the most well-known or popular
                  member of the group</p>
