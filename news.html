            <h3><strong>NEWS</strong></h3>
            <p>The history of Korean popular music can be traced back to 1885 when an American
               missionary, Henry Appenzeller, began teaching American and British folk songs at
               a school.These songs were called <em>changga</em> in Korean, and they were typically based
               on a popular Western melody sung with Korean lyrics.</p>

               <p>During the Japanese rule <em>(1910â€“1945)</em> the popularity of changga songs rose
                  as Koreans expressed their feelings against Japanese oppression through music.
                  The Japanese confiscated the existing changga collections and published lyrics
                  books of their own.The first known Korean pop album was <strong>"Yi Pungjin Sewol"</strong>,
                  by Park Chae-seon and Lee Ryu-saek in 1925, which contained popular songs
                  translated from Japanese.</p>

              <p>Dance is an integral part of K-pop. When combining multiple singers, the singers

                repetitive movements within the choreography that matches the characteristics of
                the lyrics of the song.</p>
